Now I am twenty-six years old .
I graduated from Jiangsu Science and Technology University,My major is Information management .
I have worked for Jiangsu New point software company for one year before I get graduated from school.
After graduation I worked as full-stack developer at Shanghai Kaiqing Software limited company.
Ten months later ,my leader give me double salary because my outstanding performance.But the company planed moving to Shandong province , it is very far for me so I left there.
Then I came to Hangzhou ,join the APAC CAO team of State Street .
In July 2018 I won the Recognition AWARD because I designed and pushed our team to finish a new big module for our project .Then I began to play the role of Team Leader ,leading a eight members team to reconstruct the old project and trying to expand it to a universal data center platform of State Street.
I worked very hard that time and my teammates give me a lot of help so 
We finished this work successfully and our team got lots of thankful emails from users and CEO team .
But two months ago this project's owner has been changed to another department and my two teammates left this company.
So I chose to leave State Street too and try to seek some new opportunities .
Then you r HR - Danli, Zhang contacted me so I can have this chance to interview with you

## Good Project experience
In the KPI Portal project before GSK, we need to add a completely new and complex module, because there is no relevant experience and huge workload, so we tried to ask other project groups within State Street for help, but it was rejected.
在GSK之前的KPI Portal项目中，遇到需要增添一个全新的比较复杂的模块，因为没有相关经验和巨大的工作量，所以我们尝试向State Street内部其他项目组请求帮助，但被拒绝。

Later, I designed the overall data organization structure according to the specific situation of the project members and the comprehensive advantages of my technology, and defined the style of API and some UI interaction logic, so as to make the team work effectively.
后来我根据项目成员的具体情况，以及凭借我技术比较全面的优势，设计了总体的数据组织架构，并定义了API的风格和一些UI的交互逻辑，从而让团队有效的运转起来。

At the same time, because the new module needs to export pages to PDF files, because the page size is huge, including multiple components, so the solutions that can be searched can not better meet the needs.
同时，由于新的模块需要将页面导出为PDF文件，由于页面尺寸巨大，包含多个组件，因此能够搜索到的方案都无法较好的解决需求。

Through my constant attempts, I finally developed a more perfect export function, and I also designed an additional intelligent paging strategy, so that different types of users can enjoy the same quality of service.
通过我不断的尝试，最终开发出较为完美的导出功能，并且我还额外设计了智能分页策略，从而让不同类型的用户享受到同样高质量的服务。

I won the Recognition AWARD in 2018 for this part .

## 1. Spring
### IOC
  1. Dependency injection is the dynamic injection of a dependency relationship into an object by an IOC container during its operation.
  1. 所谓依赖注入，就是由IOC容器在运行期间，动态地将某种依赖关系注入到对象之中。

  2. We can regard the working mode of IOC container as the sublimation of factory mode and IOC container as a factory. The objects to be produced in this factory are defined in the configuration file, and then the corresponding objects are generated according to the class names given in the configuration file by reflective programming language.
  2. 我们可以把IOC容器的工作模式看做是工厂模式的升华，可以把IOC容器看作是一个工厂，这个工厂里要生产的对象都在配置文件中给出定义，然后利用编程语言的的反射编程，根据配置文件中给出的类名生成相应的对象。

### AOP
1. Static proxy: compile according to the commands provided by the AOP framework, and generate AOP proxy classes at the compile stage, also known as compile-time enhancement.
  1. 静态代理：根据AOP框架提供的命令进行编译，在编译阶段生成AOP代理类，也称为编译时增强

2. Dynamic proxy: Generate temporary proxy classes at runtime using JDK or CGlib, and then load them into JVM. JDK through interfaces, CGlib through inheritance classes
  2. 动态代理：在运行时借助于JDK或者CGlib生成临时代理类，然后加载到JVM 。JDK通过接口，CGlib借助继承类

## 2. Message Broker
### 1.kafka
1. Running as a cluster on one or more servers
1. 作为集群运行在一个或多个服务器上

2. Store messages in topic category
2. 存储消息以topic为类别记录

3. Record consists of a k-v-timestamp
3. record由一个k-v-timestamp 构成

4. Based on TCP Protocol
4. 基于TCP协议

### 2.Rocket MQ
Similar to kafka, but with more distributed transactions and Message Queue, it is more useful in distributed scenarios and when sequential queues are required.
与kafka类似，但多了分布式事务和Message Queue，因此在分布式场景和需要顺序队列时更加好用。

## 3.Database
1. Dirty reading: Uncommitted write transactions are read by other transactions
1. 脏读：没有提交的写入事务被其他事务读取到了

2. Non-repeatable reads: Other transactions commit write operations between two reads, resulting in different data from the same record read (default repeatable reads)
2. 不可重复读：两次读取操作之间其他事务提交了写入操作，导致读取的同一条记录的数据是不一样的（默认可重复读）

3. Hallucination: Other transactions submit insert or delete operations between two read operations, resulting in different records read twice
3. 幻读：两次读取操作之间其他事务提交了插入或者删除操作，导致两次读取的记录是不一样的

4. Lost updates: Both transactions attempt to write, and the operation that writes first may be overwritten by the latter operation.
4. 丢失更新：两个事务都尝试写，先进行写入的操作可能会被后一个操作覆盖掉

5. Gap Lock: Locking bubbles/gap records that do not exist in the range of query keys can prevent hallucination.
5. 间隙锁：针对查询键值范围内不存在的那些气泡/间隙记录加锁，可以防止幻读

## 4.jUnit
###一个JUnit4的单元测试用例执行顺序为： 

@BeforeClass -> @Before -> @Test -> @After -> @AfterClass; 

###如何测试静态方法？
A) Change the access character of the private method to default (because the default access modifier class is accessed in the same package)
a）将private方法的访问符改为 default （因为default访问修饰符课在同一个包中访问）

B) Using reflection mechanism method. getDeclared Method ()
b） 用反射机制 method.getDeclaredMethod()

###怎么利用 JUnit 来测试一个方法的异常？
@Test(expected=xxx)
Add a Test Anotation above the method to be tested and add the expected results
在要测试的方法上方添加一个Test的Annotation，并加上期望的结果

## 5. Ecrypted Message
### 1. 对称加密
1. AES, DES

Encryption and decryption are faster, but also easier to be cracked by computers.
2. 加解密的速度更快，但也更容易被计算机破解
### 2. 非对称加密
1. RSA

Computers are not easy to crack violently
2. 计算机不容易暴力破解

### 3. 配合使用

First, the symmetric encryption key used in the session is encrypted by the asymmetric encryption algorithm.
先利用非对称加密算法对会话所用的对称加密秘钥进行加密

Then symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the information to be transmitted.
然后用对称加密算法对所要传输的信息进行加密

This allows for a better balance between security and performance.
这样可以在安全和性能之间取得更好的平衡

## 6. OOP
Encapsulation, encapsulating the specific process as a schedulable behavior, hiding the details of implementation, so that programmers can schedule the behavior at a greater granularity.
封装 ，将具体的处理过程封装为一个可供调度的行为，隐藏实现的细节，让程序员可以在更大的粒度上对行为进行调度。

Inheritance allows and encourages class reuse, allows classes with the same behavior to share functions, and greatly improves the reusability of programs.
继承， 允许和鼓励类的重用，让具有相同行为的类可以共享功能，让程序的可重用性大大提升。

Polymorphism (override, overload): Allows you to override an existing method of the same name in the parent class in a subclass, which implements isolation.
多态（重写，重载）：允许在子类中重写父类中已有的同名方法，实现了隔离。

Through object-oriented design, programmers can organize programs from a higher level, which can solve more complex problems and make the code more valuable.
通过面向对象的设计，程序员可以从更高的层次组织程序，从而可以解决更加复杂的问题，并让代码更具有价值。

## 7.Cloud
I have used Google Cloud and Aliyun to deploy and run my own blog sites and Exhibition sites.
我使用过谷歌云和阿里云，部署自己的博客网站和作品展示网站。

## 8.Micro Service
1. Micro-service refers to the development of a small service with business functions. Each service has its own processing and lightweight communication mechanism, which can be deployed on a single or multiple servers.
1. 微服务是指开发一个单个小型的但有业务功能的服务，每个服务都有自己的处理和轻量通讯机制，可以部署在单个或多个服务器上。

2. Micro-service also refers to a loosely coupled service-oriented architecture with a certain bounded context.
2. 微服务也指一种种松耦合的、有一定的有界上下文的面向服务架构。

3. That is to say, if each service needs to be modified at the same time, then they are not micro-services, because they are tightly coupled; if you need to master the use conditions of too many context scenarios for a service, then it is a service with context boundaries, which is defined from DDD domain-driven design.
3. 也就是说，如果每个服务都要同时修改，那么它们就不是微服务，因为它们紧耦合在一起；如果你需要掌握一个服务太多的上下文场景使用条件，那么它就是一个有上下文边界的服务，这个定义来自DDD领域驱动设计。

### 相对于单体架构和SOA，它的主要特点是组件化、松耦合、自治、去中心化，体现在以下几个方面：
1. A small set of services
1. 一组小的服务 
- Service granularity should be small, and each service is a package of business capabilities for a single responsibility, focusing on doing one thing well.
   - 服务粒度要小，而每个服务是针对一个单一职责的业务能力的封装，专注做好一件事情。




2. Independent deployment, operation and extension
2. 独立部署运行和扩展 
- Each service can be deployed independently and run in a process. This way of operation and deployment can give the system a flexible code organization and release rhythm, making rapid delivery and response to change possible.
   - 每个服务能够独立被部署并运行在一个进程内。这种运行和部署方式能够赋予系统灵活的代码组织方式和发布节奏，使得快速交付和应对变化成为可能。



3. Independent Development and Evolution
3. 独立开发和演化 
- The technology selection is flexible and not subject to the technical constraints of legacy systems. Appropriate business problem selection and appropriate technology can evolve independently. Language-independent APIs are adopted for integration between services and services. Compared with monolithic architecture, micro-service architecture is a more business-oriented architecture model.
   - 技术选型灵活，不受遗留系统技术约束。合适的业务问题选择合适的技术可以独立演化。服务与服务之间采取与语言无关的API进行集成。相对单体架构，微服务架构是更面向业务创新的一种架构模式。




4. Independent Team and Autonomy
4. 独立团队和自治 
- Teams are responsible for the entire life cycle of services, working in an independent context, making their own decisions and governing, without the need for a unified command center. Teams and teams connect through loose community tribes.
   - 团队对服务的整个生命周期负责，工作在独立的上下文中，自己决策自己治理，而不需要统一的指挥中心。团队和团队之间通过松散的社区部落进行衔接。

###我们可以看到整个微服务的思想就如我们现在面对信息爆炸、知识爆炸是一样的：通过解耦我们所做的事情，分而治之以减少不必要的损耗，使得整个复杂的系统和组织能够快速的应对变化。

## 9. Design Parttern
1. Singleton
 - make sure there is only one entity of the class ,you can use Enum Class ,Static inner Class and Synchronized plus Double Check
2. Proxy
 - access the proxy instead of accessing the real executor ,so you can control the executor's actions and add some extra functions into the invoking
3. Factory
 - produce entity depending on parameters
4. Observer
 -  Subject uphold a list to storing Observers who need be notified. when the corresponding event happens ,notifies them (call their event Handler)
5. Publishers + Subscribers
 - Seems like observer pattern ,but there is a broker for transferring message ,so the subject and observers are fully separated.
